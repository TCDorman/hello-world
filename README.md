# hello-world
first github repository created
Hello, my name is Colin Dorman and I am new to the github program.
A little bit about me, I am originally from Cincinnati, Ohio. 
I have been all over the world, 5 different countries 45 of the 50 States, and have lived in 4 different States. 
Growing up, sports were very important to me and took up the majority of my time. 
In 2018 I gratuated with my bachelors degree in a dual major business and sports management. 
Since then I have worked for professional sports teams, doctors offices, business to business sales and also rented exotic cars!
I am very excited for this class and look forward to learning more about computers and their systems!
